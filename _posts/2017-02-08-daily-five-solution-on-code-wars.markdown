As a Computer Science student, most of us have a dream of becoming a good programmer. Becoming a great programmer is not an easy task, one has to work hard and get up-to-date with new technology. It’s easy to learn the syntax - it’s easy to say I know this and that but the question is do you really know it?  

Skill is not about learning the syntax. Skill is an art, where someone implements syntax into a beautiful problem-solving code. Learning how to write syntax is like learning alphabets of some language. Only by learning alphabets one cannot say he/she is an expert on that language - he/she should be capable of forming words, sentences, and paragraph to achieve that level where he/she can proudly say I am an expert.



We students always focus on learning the syntax. We never write code to solve problems. Have you ever automated your day to day task using code? Most of us have never even thought of something like this before. It’s time to do something new.
