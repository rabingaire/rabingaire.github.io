New year resolution never works, most of they die in January. On 2017 I had the resolution to learn react native, nothing more just one small goal. I knew myself well (well it’s me) If I just set resolution then I will never do anything, so I wrote my new year resolution on a piece of paper and pasted on the wall of my room where I could see It while sleeping, waking up literally doing anything. This approach helped me when I had nothing to do I would see this piece of paper and start learning it. This method was so efficient that I actually completed my resolution just in a couple of months. 

This year as well I will do the same, let’s see how it goes this time. 

My new year's resolution:

1. Contribute to one open source repository with more than 100 stars.
2. Write at least one story in Nepali literature.
3. Learn golang enough to be dangerous.

Thank you for reading this, hope I could learn about your resolution do share it with me.
