Why learn JavaScript? Not to be confused with Java, JavaScript is used to build interactive websites. Over the years JavaScript has become essential to get into the web development. Furthermore, JavaScript has extended itself into the mobile app development, desktop app development, and game development hence making it the most useful skill to learn in the field of computer science.


### **Why JavaScript?** 


#### **Easy to learn:**


Yes, JavaScript is one of the easiest languages to learn. Unlike other language you don’t have to set up anything to run your JavaScript code. JavaScript comes pre-installed with modern web browsers. So how do I run JavaScript code? It’s easy (Assuming you know how to write HTML) alongside some HTML throw a bit of JavaScript and run it on a web browser great you have got your first JavaScript running.


#### **To make websites more user friendly:**


I guess you have seen some cool animations on many websites. Yes, that was the work of JavaScript. Isn’t it cool? With the use of JS libraries like [Bounce.js](http://bouncejs.com/), [Velocity.js](http://velocityjs.org/), [favico.js](http://lab.ejci.net/favico.js/) and [AniJS](http://anijs.github.io/) you could create some cool websites. 


Animation is a small thing on the sea of things JavaScript could do these days. After animation, [AJAX](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ajax/what_is_ajax.htm) pops in my head. [AJAX](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ajax/what_is_ajax.htm) stands for Asynchronous Javascript And XML. It is used to level up the interaction level of the user. Have you ever noticed how does a twitter loads new tweets or gmail loads new email? This is done with the help of [AJAX](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ajax/what_is_ajax.htm). [AJAX](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ajax/what_is_ajax.htm) enables to do some crazy stuff like loading a new data without refreshing a page.   


It’s been a couple of years since JavaScript has started to explode. Once a slow front end scripting language now can handle the backend stuff with its framework called [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) which allows you to create servers with JavaScript. Frameworks like [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/), [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/), [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) has made a lot easier to solve problems giving wings to its developers explore the world of creativity. 


I also should have to mention [JSON](http://www.json.org/) which stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is used as a popular method to transfer data due to the small file size and the ability to read and write data quickly. Most of the [API](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/19/api-defined/) build today returns and accepts data on this file format.


#### **Lots of Job:**


Not to mention the use of JavaScript is huge. It has a large number of active community. (At the time of writing this article) JavaScript is a mostly talked language on a largest question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). 


As the use of JavaScript is growing day by day vacancy searching for a good JavaScript developer is also increasing on a daily basis. JavaScript has become a thing in a software development world. It is said that that salary of a JavaScript developer ranges from a minimum of 40K to more than 120K yearly in the US.


#### **Can build a mobile app with JavaScript:**


Ever thought of making an IOS/Android app? Scared of learning some hard programming language like Java, C# and Swift/Objective C. Don’t worry, you can build an app with the help of JavaScript. I bet you have used one. Have you ever been amazed by looking at the mobile app by Facebook and Instagram? They look like any other app right? But the amazing thing about them is that were built using JavaScript.


Yes, these app use [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) which is a JavaScript framework. Along with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) there are other JS framework like [ionic](http://ionicframework.com/), [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/), [Ratchet](http://goratchet.com/) and many more existing till date.




### **At Last:**  


JavaScript has become huge over the year. This is becoming more and more popular these days. Most of the web developers these days are supposed to learn JavaScript, but there is a vast difference between just learning and being an expert on something most of the developers only know the basic of JavaScript. I suggest them to get deeper on advance topic of JavaScript and also tell them to explore the world of JS frameworks.
